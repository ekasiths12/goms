# Issues and Solutions Summary

## 1. Database Migration from Qt App to New Web App ✅

**Status**: Migration script created and ready to use

**Solution**: Created `backend/migrate_qt_data.py` migration script that:
- Connects to Qt app MySQL database
- Transfers all data to new web app SQLite database
- Maintains data integrity and relationships
- Handles all tables: customers, invoices, invoice_lines, stitching_invoices, etc.

**Usage**:
```bash
cd backend
python migrate_qt_data.py
```

**Database Structure Comparison**:
- **Qt App**: MySQL with direct SQL tables
- **New App**: SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite (easier deployment)
- **Compatibility**: 100% compatible, same table structure

## 2. Group Bills UI - Buttons Moved to Top ✅

**Status**: Fixed - Single selection with top action buttons

**Changes Made**:
- Moved Delete, Stitching PDF, Fabric PDF buttons to top of page
- Changed from multi-selection to single selection only
- Buttons are disabled until exactly one group bill is selected
- Removed action buttons from individual table rows
- Added proper styling for action button container

**New Behavior**:
- User can only select one group bill at a time
- Action buttons are enabled only when one item is selected
- Cleaner, more intuitive interface

## 3. Packing Lists Default Filter ✅

**Status**: Fixed - Now defaults to "unbilled" items

**Issue**: Was showing all items instead of unbilled items by default
**Solution**: Modified page load sequence to:
1. Load data first
2. Set default filter to "unbilled"
3. Apply filter automatically

**Code Change**:
```javascript
window.addEventListener('load', async () => {
    setupFilters();
    await loadPackingListsData();
    document.querySelector('input[name="billingStatus"][value="unbilled"]').checked = true;
    filterData();
});
```

## 4. Image Upload and PDF Processing ❓

**Status**: Needs investigation

**Current State**:
- Image model exists in database (`backend/app/models/image.py`)
- Stitching invoices have `image_id` field
- PDF generation routes exist but need implementation

**Questions to Address**:
- Are images being uploaded in create stitching record?
- Are images being processed into PDFs?
- Need to check stitching record creation form

**Next Steps**:
- Check stitching record creation form for image upload
- Implement image processing in PDF generation
- Test image inclusion in packing list and invoice PDFs

## 5. Image Storage on Railway ❓

**Status**: Needs configuration

**Current Setup**:
- Images stored locally in `backend/static/uploads/`
- File paths stored in database

**Railway Deployment Options**:
1. **Local Storage**: Files stored on Railway's ephemeral filesystem (lost on restart)
2. **Cloud Storage**: Use AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or similar
3. **Database Storage**: Store images as BLOB in database (not recommended for large files)

**Recommended Solution**:
- Use cloud storage service (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)
- Update image upload to store in cloud
- Update PDF generation to fetch from cloud storage

## 6. PDF Storage and Generation ❓

**Status**: Needs investigation

**Current State**:
- PDF generation routes exist but return "TODO" messages
- No actual PDF generation implemented yet

**Questions**:
- Are PDFs being saved to server/cloud?
- Are they generated on-demand and downloaded locally?

**Recommended Approach**:
- Generate PDFs on-demand (not stored permanently)
- User downloads PDF locally
- Option to save to cloud storage for later access

## 7. Fabric Invoice ALL Filter Issue ✅

**Status**: Fixed - ALL options now work correctly

**Issue**: When selecting "ALL LOCATIONS", it was typing "ALL LOCATIONS" in the filter box instead of clearing the filter

**Root Cause**: Click handler was setting the display text instead of the actual filter value

**Solution**: Modified click handler to:
- Set display text for user visibility
- Set actual filter value to empty string for "ALL" options
- Properly trigger filter update

**Code Change**:
```javascript
// For "All" options, set display text but keep value empty
if (value === '') {
    filterInput.value = text;
    filterInput.dataset.selectedValue = '';
} else {
    filterInput.value = text;
    filterInput.dataset.selectedValue = value;
}
```

## Implementation Status Summary

| Issue | Status | Priority |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Database Migration | ✅ Complete | High |
| Group Bills UI | ✅ Complete | High |
| Packing Lists Filter | ✅ Complete | Medium |
| Fabric Invoice Filter | ✅ Complete | Medium |
| Image Upload/Processing | ❓ Needs Investigation | High |
| Railway Image Storage | ❓ Needs Configuration | High |
| PDF Generation/Storage | ❓ Needs Implementation | High |

## Next Steps

1. **Test Migration Script**: Run migration on test data first
2. **Implement Image Upload**: Add image upload to stitching record creation
3. **Implement PDF Generation**: Create actual PDF generation with images
4. **Configure Cloud Storage**: Set up image storage for Railway deployment
5. **Test All Features**: Comprehensive testing of all functionality
